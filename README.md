# BeatTheVirus

## Introduction
In This project, we build an android app that will help to follow social distancing during COVID-19. The basic idea behind this app is the estimation of the distance between two mobile devices on the basis of the signal strength of the Bluetooth signal received at the mobile device. As any other device whose bluetooth is on comes close ( less then 1m) to your device, the app will sound an alarm and alert you to maintain a distance. So that you can maintain social distancing to each other.
